You are given a fifo that works on two different clock domains. 
We ask you to:

1. Fix any bugs in the TB and the code and give a very short description of each one.
2. insert comments where you see fit in order to make the code more readable.
3. complete the testbench in order to test the functionality of the o_err_wOnFull and o_err_rOnEmpty signals.
4. make the width of the fifo generic.
5. why could the counters be implemented like this? Is there a better counter or a better available implementation?
6. are there any precautions one should take in order to make a more robust design reguarding the backend flow?
